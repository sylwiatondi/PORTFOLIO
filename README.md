### About Me
 My name is Sylwia Tonderska this is my first story related to the IT industry, for a long time I have just wanted to try automated testing. 
 I intend to continue my education in this field. 
 I became interested in this field as a result of observing the market and its highly developed technical development. 
 The world is constantly rushing forward especially in the area of technology and artificial intelligence. 
 Thanks to my experience, I have highly developed interpersonal skills and empathy. 
 I enjoy working in a team, getting to know people and their diversity which further expands my interpersonal skills.
 I am a fast learner and persistent in pursuing the goals I set for myself but also those set by the organization.
 My ability to learn quickly and my constant inquisitiveness and openness to the new allows me to prove every day that self-improvement is the basis of tester development. 

### Experience
My experience abroad at Hewlett-Packard and IBM as a quality controller and machine operator has given me an understanding of the importance of the details that make up the whole product. This is exactly how it is in testing. Sometimes a small detail affects the whole functioning of an application. 
  
My previous experience is interior design in a program in pro100, and creating cut layouts, grading and garment construction in Gemini Cad. Subsequent design work and thus working with the customer is a great experience of how important the customer and his expectations are. It is necessary to be constantly open to any changes, but also to skillfully show the client that sometimes another solution can have a better effect and outcome.
